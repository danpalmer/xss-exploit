<h2>Hello Webmaster</h2>
<p>You are probably here because you saw this URL in your logs as being the origin for a cross-site scripting exploit.</p>
<p>This site simply hosts the scripts and has not actually exploited your website. The Javascript that was injected has not stolen user data and should be totally safe.</p>
<p>The code for this website can be found at <a href="http://github.com/danpalmer/xss-exploit">danpalmer/xss-exploit</a> on GitHub. Please note however that this repository was designed to be easily deployable to different hosting providers and therefore the contributors should not be assumed to be involved with the exploit.</p>
<p>For more information on cross-site scripting and how to prevent it, please visit <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)</a>.</p>
